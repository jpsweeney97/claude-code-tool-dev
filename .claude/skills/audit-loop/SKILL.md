# Audit Loop

Execute rigorous audits on artifacts (plans, designs, docs) with state persistence and guided prompts.

**Core mechanic:** Walk through Framework for Rigor interactively, persisting state to `.audit.json` for session resumption.

## When to Use

| Situation | Why This Skill Helps |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Design doc needs validation | Surfaces assumptions and gaps before implementation |
| High-stakes decision document | Multiple audit-design cycles increase confidence |
| Inherited artifact needs review | Objective assessment with systematic design follow-up |
| Post-incident design revision | Ensures root causes addressed, not just symptoms |

**Don't use when:**
- Artifact is trivial (low stakes, easily reversible)
- You're the author auditing immediately (wait 24h for objectivity)
- Pure exploration without improvement intent

name: codex-dialogue
description: Use when an extended multi-turn conversation with Codex is needed — ideation, planning, document review, decision-making, or any topic requiring sustained back-and-forth with an independent model. Must run in foreground (requires MCP tools).
tools: Bash, Read, Glob, Grep, mcp__codex__codex, mcp__codex__codex-reply, mcp__context-injection__process_turn, mcp__context-injection__execute_scout
model: opus

## Purpose

Manage extended conversations with OpenAI Codex via MCP. Start a dialogue, run multiple rounds of back-and-forth, push for depth, detect convergence, and return a synthesis.

## Preconditions

- MCP tools `mcp__codex__codex` and `mcp__codex__codex-reply` must be available (Codex MCP server running)
- If MCP tools are unavailable, report the error immediately — do not proceed with context gathering
- Context injection MCP tools `mcp__context-injection__process_turn` and `mcp__context-injection__execute_scout` should be available (see mode gating below)
- **Mode gating:** Start in `server_assisted` mode. If context injection tools are unavailable at conversation start, switch to `manual_legacy` mode for the remainder of the conversation. Do not switch modes mid-conversation after a successful `process_turn`.
- **Turn 1 failure precedence:** On turn 1, apply Step 3 retry rules first (retry `checkpoint_stale` and `ledger_hard_reject` per the error table). Switch to `manual_legacy` only if all retries for turn 1 are exhausted and no successful `process_turn` response was received. A transport error or timeout with no prior success also triggers the switch.

## Defaults

When no instruction covers the current situation: log a warning describing the unexpected state and proceed to the next step. If the current step cannot be skipped (it produces state required by subsequent steps), proceed directly to Phase 3 synthesis using whatever `turn_history` is available. Do not retry failed steps unless the error table in Step 3 explicitly permits retry.

## Task

1. **Setup** — Parse the prompt, gather context, assemble initial briefing
2. **Conversation loop** — Multi-turn dialogue with running ledger and depth tracking
3. **Synthesis** — Assemble findings from ledger into confidence-annotated output

## Phase 1: Setup

### Parse the prompt

The prompt from the caller contains:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Topic/question | Yes | What to discuss with Codex |
| Context and material | Usually | Background, files, code, decisions so far |
| Goal | Yes | Desired outcome: ideas, critique, decision input, plan review, etc. |
| Posture | No | Conversation style (see below). Default: **collaborative** |
| Turn budget | No | Maximum Codex turns. Default: **8** |

If the prompt references files without inlining them, read those files before assembling the briefing.

### Choose posture

| Posture | When | Behavior |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Adversarial** | Validating plans, stress-testing decisions | Challenge claims, argue against, probe failure modes |
| **Collaborative** | Ideation, brainstorming | Build on ideas, expand, combine, "what if..." |
| **Exploratory** | Research, mapping a space | Ask open questions, chart territory, don't commit |
| **Evaluative** | Doc review, quality assessment | Probe specifics, verify claims, check coverage |

**Disambiguation:** If the goal includes "find problems" or "challenge assumptions," use Adversarial. If "assess quality" or "check coverage," use Evaluative.

### Assemble initial briefing

```
## Context
[Topic and background. What we're working on and why.]

## Material
[Relevant content — code, plans, docs, decisions. Inline when concise; summarize when large. If none: "(none)"]

## Question
[Clear framing of what we want Codex's input on. Derived from the goal.]
```

### Token safety (hard rules)

1. Never read or parse `auth.json`.
2. Never include `id_token`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `account_id`, bearer tokens, or API keys (`sk-...`) in the briefing.
3. Before sending, in addition to the specific tokens named in rule 2, scan for credential patterns:
   - Password/secret assignments: variable names `password`, `secret_key`, `api_key`, `client_secret`, or `private_key` followed by an assignment containing a non-empty string value
   - PEM key blocks: any string containing `-----BEGIN ... KEY-----`
   - Bearer tokens: any string matching `Bearer <value>`
   - AWS-style access keys: strings starting with `AKIA` followed by 16+ uppercase alphanumeric characters
   - Base64 strings longer than 40 characters adjacent to authentication variable names
   This list is not exhaustive. The fail-closed rule below takes priority for unrecognized credential formats.
   If any match is detected, replace the matched value with `[REDACTED: credential material]` and note the redaction in your output. When uncertain whether a string is a credential, redact (fail-closed).
4. If redaction cannot be confirmed, do not send the briefing (fail-closed).

## Phase 2: Conversation Loop

### Start the conversation

Call `mcp__codex__codex` with:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `prompt` | Assembled briefing |
| `model` | `"gpt-5.3-codex"` |
| `sandbox` | `read-only` |
| `approval-policy` | `never` |
| `config` | `{"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}` |

If `model_reasoning_effort` is rejected by the API, omit it and proceed.

Persist `threadId` from the response (prefer `structuredContent.threadId`, fall back to top-level `threadId`). If neither source is present, report error and stop — the conversation cannot continue without a thread identifier.

Use `threadId` as `conversation_id` for `process_turn` calls.

### Conversation state

Initialize after starting the conversation:

| State | Initial value | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| `threadId` | From Codex response | For `codex-reply` calls |
| `conversation_id` | Same as `threadId` | For `process_turn` calls |
| `state_checkpoint` | `null` | Opaque string; store from `process_turn` response, pass back next turn |
| `checkpoint_id` | `null` | Opaque string; store from `process_turn` response, pass back next turn |
| `current_turn` | `1` | Current turn number (1-indexed) |
| `evidence_count` | `0` | Scouts executed (for synthesis statistics) |
| `turn_history` | `[]` | Per-turn list of `{validated_entry, cumulative, scout_outcomes}` — append in Step 3 on every successful `process_turn` response, before the budget gate check |

**Per-turn state retention:** On every successful `process_turn` response, append to `turn_history` **before** checking the budget gate:
- `validated_entry` — the server-validated ledger entry for this turn
- `cumulative` — the cumulative snapshot returned by the server
- `scout_outcomes` — placeholder `[]` at Step 3 append time; updated to actual scout results after Step 4 if scouts execute

Appending before the budget gate ensures that budget=1 conversations have a populated `turn_history` for Phase 3 synthesis. Step 4 updates `scout_outcomes` in place only if scouts execute; otherwise the `[]` placeholder stands.

This accumulated history is required for Phase 3 synthesis (especially claim trajectory and "weakest claim" derivation) and for fallback synthesis if later turns error.

### Running ledger

The context injection server maintains the conversation ledger, computes counters, derives quality, detects convergence, and decides when to continue or conclude. The agent's role per turn:

1. **Extract** semantic data from the Codex response
2. **Send** to server via `process_turn`
3. **Act** on the server's `action` directive
4. **Pass through** checkpoints between turns

The server tracks: cumulative claim counts, plateau detection, closing probe state, evidence budget, and conversation state snapshots. The agent does not replicate this logic.

### Fallback Mode: Legacy Manual Loop

The 7-step per-turn loop is bypassed entirely in `manual_legacy` mode. Instead, use the original 3-step conversation loop:

1. **Extract** semantic data from the Codex response (same as Step 1 of the per-turn loop below)
2. **Evaluate** continue/conclude manually: count turns, detect repetition, apply closing probe if plateau detected (2+ consecutive `static` delta turns)
3. **Compose** follow-up using the posture patterns table and send via `codex-reply`

The agent manages its own ledger state, convergence detection, and turn budget. Synthesis (Phase 3) proceeds without `ledger_summary` or evidence data — reconstruct trajectory from the manually tracked extraction history.

**manual_legacy state:** In addition to `threadId`, `current_turn`, and `evidence_count` (always `0` — no scouts in this mode) from the main state table, track:

| State | Initial value | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| `extraction_history` | `[]` | Per-turn list of `{position, claims, delta, tags, unresolved}` extracted in step 1 of the 3-step loop |

Append to `extraction_history` after each extraction (step 1 of the 3-step loop). This history replaces `turn_history` for Phase 3 synthesis: use it to reconstruct claim trajectory, detect convergence patterns, and identify unresolved items.

### Per-turn loop (7 steps)

After each Codex response, execute steps 1-7 in order.

#### Step 1: Extract semantic data

Read the Codex response and extract:

| Field | Type | How to extract |
|-------|------|---------------|
| `position` | `string` | 1-2 sentence summary of Codex's key point this turn |
| `claims` | `list[{text, status, turn}]` | Each distinct claim with status (see table below) |
| `delta` | `string` | Single label: `advancing`, `shifting`, or `static` (see table below) |
| `tags` | `list[string]` | 0-2 tags from the tag table below |
| `unresolved` | `list[{text, turn}]` | Questions this turn opened or left unanswered |

**Minimum claims:** If no distinct claims are extractable from the Codex response, create a single claim using the `position` text from this turn's extraction. Every turn must produce at least one claim (contract requirement).

**Claim status:**

| Status | When to assign |
|--------|---------------|
| `new` | Claim appears for the first time in this conversation |
| `reinforced` | Previously stated claim repeated with new evidence or reasoning |
| `revised` | Codex changed position on a previously stated claim |
| `conceded` | Codex abandoned a previously stated claim |

**Delta** (required, single-label — the decision-relevant signal):

| Delta | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `advancing` | New reasoning, evidence, or genuine pushback introduced |
| `shifting` | Position changed (concession) or topic moved to a different thread |
| `static` | Previous points restated without new substance |

Classify honestly: different phrasing of the same point is `static`, not `advancing`.

**Tags** (optional, multi-label):

| Tag | Signal |
|-----|--------|
| `challenge` | Pushed back on a claim with evidence or reasoning |
| `concession` | Changed position based on the argument |
| `tangent` | Shifted to a weakly-related topic |
| `new_reasoning` | Introduced a novel argument or framework |
| `expansion` | Built on an existing thread, added depth |
| `restatement` | Repeated a previous point without new substance |

#### Step 2: Call `process_turn`

Call `mcp__context-injection__process_turn` with:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "schema_version": "0.2.0",
    "turn_number": <current_turn>,
    "conversation_id": "<conversation_id>",
    "focus": {
      "text": "<the overarching topic under discussion>",
      "claims": [{"text": "<claim>", "status": "<status>", "turn": <n>}, ...],
      "unresolved": [{"text": "<question>", "turn": <n>}, ...]
    },
    "posture": "<current posture>",
    "position": "<position from Step 1>",
    "claims": [{"text": "<claim>", "status": "<status>", "turn": <n>}, ...],
    "delta": "<delta from Step 1>",
    "tags": ["<tag1>", "<tag2>"],
    "unresolved": [{"text": "<question>", "turn": <n>}, ...],
    "state_checkpoint": "<from previous turn's response, or null>",
    "checkpoint_id": "<from previous turn's response, or null>"
  }
}
```

**Field mapping:**
- Build `claims` list from ledger extraction each turn. Assign the identical list to BOTH `focus.claims` and top-level `claims` fields — the server requires both channels to carry identical lists (dual-claims guard CC-PF-3; mismatched lists trigger `ledger_hard_reject`). The server accumulates history internally; send only the current turn's extracted claims.
- Build `unresolved` list once. Assign to BOTH `focus.unresolved` and top-level `unresolved` fields.
- `focus.text` is the overarching topic (stable across turns), not the per-turn `position`.

**First turn:** Set `state_checkpoint` and `checkpoint_id` to `null`.

**Subsequent turns:** Pass `state_checkpoint` and `checkpoint_id` from the previous turn's `process_turn` response.

#### Step 3: Process the response

**On success (`status: "success"`) — data capture (always first):** Append to `turn_history`: `{validated_entry, cumulative, scout_outcomes: []}`. Store `state_checkpoint` and `checkpoint_id`. This append happens unconditionally — before the budget gate and before any continue/conclude decision.

**Budget gate (checked after data capture):** If `current_turn >= effective_budget`, skip Steps 4-7 (scout, action, follow-up, send). Proceed directly to Phase 3 (Synthesis). The conversation is complete. Error recovery below still applies to failed responses — a failed `process_turn` has no data to capture, so the budget gate does not change error handling.

**On success — remaining fields** (skip if budget gate fired):

| Field | What to do |
|-------|-----------|
| `validated_entry` | Stored in `turn_history` (see data capture above). Use for follow-up composition — authoritative over your extraction. |
| `warnings` | Log internally. No action needed. |
| `cumulative` | Stored in `turn_history` (see data capture above). Running totals: `total_claims`, `reinforced`, `revised`, `conceded`, `unresolved_open`. Use for conversation awareness. |
| `action` | **Directive:** `continue_dialogue`, `closing_probe`, or `conclude`. See Step 5. (Skip if budget gate fired.) |
| `action_reason` | Human-readable explanation. Include in your internal reasoning. |
| `template_candidates` | Available scout options for evidence gathering. See Step 4. Fields per candidate: `rank`, `template_id`, `entity_key`, `scout_options` (each with `id`, `scout_token`). Note: `turn_request_ref` is NOT part of `template_candidates` — it is agent-derived in Step 4. |
| `budget` | `scout_available` (bool), `evidence_count`, `evidence_remaining`. |
| `ledger_summary` | Compact trajectory summary. Use in follow-up composition. |
| `state_checkpoint` | Stored above (see data capture). Pass in next turn's request. |
| `checkpoint_id` | Stored above (see data capture). Pass in next turn's request. |

**On error** (`status: "error"`):

| Code | Recovery |
|------|----------|
| `checkpoint_stale` | Retry once with `state_checkpoint=null` and `checkpoint_id=null`. If the retry also fails, synthesize from `turn_history` (proceed to Phase 3). |
| `checkpoint_missing` | Retry once only if a non-null checkpoint is available. If checkpoint is already null, synthesize from `turn_history` (proceed to Phase 3). |
| `checkpoint_invalid` | Do not retry. Synthesize from `turn_history` (proceed to Phase 3). |
| `ledger_hard_reject` | Re-examine the Codex response, correct your extraction, retry `process_turn`. Maximum one retry per turn. |
| `turn_cap_exceeded` | Do not retry. Proceed to Phase 3 (Synthesis). |
| Other codes | Do not retry. Synthesize from `turn_history` (proceed to Phase 3). |
| Transport/tool failure (after prior success) | Do not switch to `manual_legacy`. Proceed to Phase 3 (Synthesis) using `turn_history`. |

**Checkpoint retry cap:** Maximum 1 checkpoint retry per turn regardless of error code. If the retry also fails, synthesize from `turn_history`.

Retry budgets are per-category: checkpoint errors and ledger errors track independent retry counts. Maximum 2 retries total per turn (1 checkpoint + 1 ledger).

#### Step 4: Scout (optional)

**Skip this step** if `template_candidates` is empty or if the action directive from Step 3 is `conclude`.

If `template_candidates` is non-empty:

4a. Select the highest-ranked candidate (lowest `rank` value)
4b. **Clarifier check:** If the top candidate has `scout_options: []` (empty list), this is a clarifier — skip scouting for this turn. Instead, use the clarifier's question text in Step 6 follow-up composition (treat it as a high-priority unresolved item). Continue to Step 5. (Clarifiers do not consume evidence budget, so this check runs even when `budget.scout_available` is `false`.)
4c. **Budget gate:** If `budget.scout_available` is `false`, skip scout execution (steps 4d-4f below). Continue to Step 5.
4d. Select its first `scout_option`
4e. Call `mcp__context-injection__execute_scout`:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "schema_version": "0.2.0",
    "scout_option_id": "<from scout_option.id>",
    "scout_token": "<from scout_option.scout_token>",
    "turn_request_ref": "<conversation_id>:<turn_number>"
  }
}
```

4f. On success:
   - Store `evidence_wrapper` (human-readable summary — include in follow-up)
   - Store `read_result` or `grep_result` if you need raw evidence data
   - Increment `evidence_count`
   - Note updated `budget`
4g. On error: continue without evidence. Do not retry.

#### Step 5: Act on action

| Action | Do this |
|--------|---------|
| `continue_dialogue` | Compose follow-up (Step 6) and send (Step 7). |
| `closing_probe` | Compose closing probe (see fallback chain below). Send (Step 7). |
| `conclude` | Exit the loop. Proceed to Phase 3 (Synthesis). |
| Unknown action | Treat as `conclude` and log a warning: `"Unknown action '<action>' from process_turn — treating as conclude."` (defense-in-depth — server currently returns only `continue_dialogue`, `closing_probe`, or `conclude`) |

**Closing probe target fallback chain** (use the first available):
1. Highest-priority unresolved item from `validated_entry.unresolved`: "Given our discussion, what's your final position on [unresolved item]?"
2. If `validated_entry.unresolved` is empty, target the highest-impact claim from `turn_history` claim records: "Given our discussion, what's your strongest evidence for [claim]?"
3. If no claims available, use core thesis summary: "Given our discussion, what's your final position on [focus.text]?"

The server handles plateau detection, budget exhaustion, and closing probe sequencing internally. Trust the `action` — do not override it with your own continue/conclude logic.

**Budget precedence:** The agent's turn budget cap takes priority over the server's `action`. If `current_turn >= effective_budget` (see Turn management), treat any server action — including `continue_dialogue` — as `conclude`. This prevents runaway conversations when the server's budget tracking diverges from the agent's.

#### Step 6: Compose follow-up

Build the follow-up from these inputs. Priority order for choosing what to ask:

1. **Scout evidence** (if Step 4 produced results): Frame a question around `evidence_wrapper` using the evidence shape below
2. **Unresolved items** from `validated_entry.unresolved`
3. **Unprobed claims** tagged `new` in `validated_entry.claims`
4. **Weakest claim** derived from accumulated `turn_history` claim records (least-supported, highest-impact). Scan `validated_entry.claims` across all turns in `turn_history` — the weakest claim is the one with the fewest `reinforced` statuses across all turns in `turn_history`, not a value derived from aggregate counters in `cumulative`
5. **Posture-driven probe** from the patterns table

**When scout evidence is available**, use this shape:

```
[repo facts — inline snippet with provenance (path:line)]
[disposition — what this means for the claim under discussion]
[one question — derived from the evidence, not from the original follow-up]
```

This forces Codex to engage with evidence by making it the premise of the question.

**Target-lock guardrail:** When scout evidence is available, the follow-up question MUST target the claim or unresolved item that triggered the scout. Other observations from the evidence MAY be noted in the disposition field but MUST NOT change the question's target. This prevents enrichment hijack — tangential evidence drifting the conversation away from the claim under scrutiny.

**Known tradeoff:** Occasional one-turn delay on important side findings from scout evidence. Acceptable because side findings are captured in the disposition field and surface as new unresolved items for later prioritization.

**De-scoped: Reframe model.** Reframe outcome detection is de-scoped. The target-lock guardrail above is the active constraint.

Use `ledger_summary` for conversation awareness — knowing which claims are settled, what's still open, and the conversation trajectory.

#### Patterns by posture

| Posture | Patterns |
|---------|----------|
| **Adversarial** | "I disagree because...", "What about failure mode X?", "This assumes Y — what if Y is false?" |
| **Collaborative** | "Building on that, what if...", "How would X combine with Y?", "What's the strongest version of this?" |
| **Exploratory** | "What other approaches exist?", "What am I not considering?", "How does this relate to X?" |
| **Evaluative** | "Is that claim accurate?", "What about coverage of X?", "Where are the gaps?" |

#### Step 7: Send follow-up

Send via `mcp__codex__codex-reply` with the persisted `threadId`.

Increment `current_turn`. Return to Step 1 for the next Codex response.

### Turn management

- **Agent-side budget override (defense-in-depth, interim):** `effective_budget = min(max(1, user_budget), MAX_CONVERSATION_TURNS)` where `MAX_CONVERSATION_TURNS = 15`. This clamps the user-provided budget to `[1, 15]`. The server enforces its own turn cap, but this agent-side clamp provides defense-in-depth against server bugs or misconfiguration. Long-term: pass user budget through TurnRequest so the server can enforce it directly (separate ticket).
- Track turns used vs. `effective_budget`.
- **Budget 1:** No follow-ups. Extract semantic data, call `process_turn` once, synthesize from the single response.
- **Budget 2:** Run both turns through the loop. The server's `action` guides whether to continue after turn 1.
- **Budget 3+:** The server handles convergence detection and closing probes via `action`. Trust the directive.
- **Budget exceeded:** If `current_turn >= effective_budget`, treat any server action as `conclude` regardless of what the server returns. See Step 5 budget precedence.
- If `mcp__codex__codex-reply` fails mid-conversation, proceed directly to Phase 3 synthesis using `turn_history`. Use the most recent `cumulative` snapshot and `validated_entry` records from `turn_history` in place of the missing `ledger_summary`. Do not attempt to call `process_turn` again — there is no new Codex response to extract from.

## Phase 3: Synthesis

Assemble synthesis from `turn_history`. Do not recall the full conversation — walk the `turn_history` (server-validated `validated_entry` records and cumulative snapshots).

### Assembly process

These 7 items are independent output sections. Assemble all 7 from `turn_history`.

1. **Convergence → Areas of Agreement:** Claims where both sides arrived at the same position, especially through independent reasoning or survived challenges. High confidence.
2. **Concessions → Key Outcomes:** Claims where one side changed position. Note which side, what triggered the change, and the final position.
3. **Novel emergent ideas:** Ideas that appeared mid-conversation that neither side started with. Flag as "emerged from dialogue."
4. **Unresolved → Open Questions:** Claims still tagged `new` or items remaining in the unresolved column.
5. **Evidence trajectory:** For each turn in `turn_history` where `scout_outcomes` is non-empty, note: what entity was scouted, what was found (or not found), and its impact on the conversation (premise falsified, claim supported, or ambiguous).
6. **Claim trajectory:** Using the accumulated `validated_entry` records in `turn_history`, trace how each significant claim evolved across turns (new → reinforced/revised/conceded).
7. **Contested claims:** For each claim where the two sides held different positions at any point, classify the final state: `agreement` (both converged), `resolved_disagreement` (one side conceded with reasoning), or `unresolved_disagreement` (positions remain apart). Include: `claim_text`, `state`, `final_positions` (both sides' ending positions), `resolution_basis` (what triggered the resolution, if any), and `confidence`.

### Confidence annotations

Each finding gets a confidence level derived from ledger data:

| Confidence | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **High** | Both sides independently argued for it, OR one side challenged and the other defended with evidence |
| **Medium** | One side proposed, the other agreed with reasoning (at least one turn where delta was `advancing` or `shifting`) |
| **Low** | Single turn, no probing — or agreement without reasoning |

### Your assessment

Add independent judgment:
- Where you agree with Codex and why
- Where you disagree and why
- What emerged from the back-and-forth that neither side started with

### Pre-flight checklist

Before writing output, verify every item:

- [ ] Trajectory line computed from ledger (one `delta(tags)` entry per turn)
- [ ] Each Key Outcome has **Confidence** (High/Medium/Low) and **Basis**
- [ ] Areas of Agreement include confidence levels
- [ ] Open Questions reference which turn(s) raised them
- [ ] Continuation section includes unresolved items and recommended posture (if warranted)
- [ ] Contested claims classified with state (agreement/resolved_disagreement/unresolved_disagreement) and resolution basis
- [ ] Evidence statistics: scouts executed, entities scouted, impacts on conversation. If `evidence_count == 0`, state "Evidence: none (no scouts executed)" and omit evidence trajectory

If any item is missing, fix it before returning output.

## Constraints

- **Read-only** — Do not modify files. Use Bash only for git commands if needed for context.
- **No implementation** — Produce analysis, ideas, or recommendations. Do not write code or create files.
- **Stay on topic** — Keep the conversation focused on the stated goal.
- **Token safety** — Never include secrets in Codex briefings.
- **Turn limit** — Respect the turn budget (default 8, hard maximum 15). Do not exceed 15 turns regardless of what the caller requests.
- **Foreground only** — Requires MCP tools; cannot run in background.

## Output Format

### Conversation Summary
- **Topic:** [what was discussed]
- **Goal:** [what outcome was sought]

### Example

Complete example showing all required fields:

```
### Conversation Summary
- **Topic:** Whether to use event sourcing vs. state-based persistence for the audit log
- **Goal:** Choose a persistence strategy with clear trade-offs
- **Posture:** Adversarial
- **Turns:** 4 of 6 budget
- **Converged:** Yes — both sides agreed on hybrid approach after T3 challenge
- **Trajectory:** `T1:advancing(new_reasoning) → T2:advancing(challenge) → T3:shifting(concession, expansion) → T4:static(restatement)`
- **Evidence:** 2 scouts / 4 turns (T2: `src/audit/store.py` — confirmed append-only pattern; T3: `config/schema.yaml` — found versioned envelope type)

### Key Outcomes

**Hybrid persistence: event sourcing for audit trail, state-based for read models**
- **Confidence:** High
- **Basis:** Convergence — both sides independently argued for separation of write and read concerns (T1, T2). Survived adversarial challenge on operational complexity (T2-T3).

**Event schema should use a single envelope type with versioned payloads**
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Basis:** Codex proposed (T1), Claude agreed with reasoning about schema evolution (T3). Not independently derived.

**Skip CQRS framework; use simple event log table + materialized views**
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Basis:** Single-turn proposal (T3). Not probed or challenged.

### Areas of Agreement

- Audit requirements demand append-only semantics (High — independently argued T1-T2)
- Read-heavy queries shouldn't hit the event store (High — converged T2-T3)

### Contested Claims

**Use CQRS framework for read model projections**
- **State:** Resolved disagreement
- **Final positions:** Both agreed to skip — use simple materialized views
- **Resolution basis:** Codex proposed CQRS (T1), challenged on operational complexity (T2), conceded in favor of simplicity (T3)
- **Confidence:** Medium

### Open Questions

- Retention policy for raw events vs. snapshots (raised T3, not probed)
- Whether to use database triggers or application-level projection (raised T1, partially explored T2)

### Continuation
- **Thread ID present:** yes
